Popular travel times
Most used stations
Trip durations
User demographics
Optional raw data previews

How the Program Works

The script performs the following steps:
Asks the user to choose a city
Asks for month and day filters
Loads and filters the city dataset
Calculates and displays various statistics
Allows users to view raw data (5 rows at a time)
Gives the option to restart the program
