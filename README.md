# Bikeshare Project

Date Created 
12.12.2025

Project Title 
Explore US Bikeshare Data

Descrption
In this project, I explored bikeshare data for three major U.S. cities — Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
I wrote Python code to import and analyze the data, and I answered several questions by calculating descriptive statistics.
I also created an interactive terminal experience where the user can filter the data and view different insights based on city, month, and day.

File Used
To complete this project, I worked primarily in the bikeshare.py file, which contains helper code and comments provided in the Udacity template.
Although the project requires the following dataset files, I did not upload them to GitHub (as per project rules):
chicago.csv,new_york_city.csv,washington.csv

The Datasets
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

How I Run the Program

To run the project, I am using Jupyter notebook and running:
python bikeshare.py

The program then walks me through:
Selecting a city
Filtering by month
Filtering by day of the week
Viewing calculated statistics

Credits

I completed this project as part of the Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree by Udacity.
